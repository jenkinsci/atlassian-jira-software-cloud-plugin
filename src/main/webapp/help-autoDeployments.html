    Enable this setting to send deployment data to Jira whenever any pipeline on this server completes a deployment stage with a name matching the regex filter specified.<br>
    Deployment stages must include an environment name (for example "deploy to prod") to send environment data to Jira. Use (?&lt;envname&gt;.*)$ in the regex filter to extract and send environment names.<br>
    Only use this setting if your teams have a consistent naming convention for deployment stages in their Jenkinsfiles.
