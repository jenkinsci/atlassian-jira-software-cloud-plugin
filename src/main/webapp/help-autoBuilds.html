    Enable this setting to send build data to Jira whenever any pipeline on this server completes a build stage with a name matching the regex filter specified.<br>
    If no filter is specified, build data will be sent whenever any pipeline on this server is run successfully.<br>
    Only use this setting with a regex filter if your teams have a consistent naming convention for build stages in their Jenkinsfiles.
